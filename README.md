## About

This is a simple command-line weather application built with Dart, following the Clean Architecture principles. It fetches hourly weather data (mocked) for a given city and displays it in a readable terminal output. The project is structured into clear layers (data,core,domain, and presentation), making it modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.

Perfect for practicing architecture patterns. 

Below is a sample hourly temperature output for **Washington**:
